Name: OWASP SecLists Project (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Projects/OWASP_SecLists_Project)
Purpose: SecLists is a collection of multiple types of lists used during security assessments. List types include usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data grep strings, fuzzing payloads, and many more.
The goal is to enable a security tester to pull this repo onto a new testing box and have access to every type of list that may be needed.
